- All work is done on separate branch from master:

  ```sh
  git checkout master
  git checkout -b my-task-name
  ```

- Push commit to new branch as soon as some work is done, even if feature isn't complete.
- Create a draft pull request as soon as you push
- Add `Closes #` and select issue in PR description so the issue is linked to the PR and is
  auto-closed on merge
