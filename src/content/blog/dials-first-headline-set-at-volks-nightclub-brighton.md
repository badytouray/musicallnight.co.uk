### How it all started

People from various backgrounds may come together via music since it is a universal language. After
six years of hard effort, Dial, who has dedicated his life to his craft, will finally perform his
first-ever headline concert at Brighton's storied Volks nightclub. He has had Music All Night's
support from the beginning, and we look forward to sharing this significant occasion with him.

The adventure of Dial began six years ago, when he initially experimented with concepts for "cool
drops." He soon came to the conclusion that producing was more than just a hobby and chose to pursue
it. He began with EDM and experimented with several genres before settling on drum and bass.

### The expansion

Even if they succeed in doing so, most DJs find it difficult to support themselves with their gifted
abilities. Dial has established a name for himself in the Drum and Bass music industry despite the
many obstacles and emotional roller coasters over the previous six years. One of his productions
received airplay on Radio 1, which enabled him reach the top of the Hypedit DNB chart three times
and amassed over 700k plays across all platforms. It's no surprise that he's finally getting his
first headlining set because of his perseverance and commitment to his profession.

Dial has had Music All Night by his side every step of the way, encouraging and challenging him to
be the best version of himself. We have witnessed his artistic growth and development, and we are
tremendously proud of all that he has accomplished. It has been a privilege to watch him blossom and
take the stage as a headliner.

### The ideal location

The Volks nightclub is the ideal location for Dial's debut headlining performance. It's a legendary
club that has long led Brighton's Drum and Bass music scene, making it the ideal setting to display
Dial's distinctive sound. The crowd is always up for a huge rave while pulling the iconic bass face,
the atmosphere is electrifying, and the sound system, RC1, is unmatched. It's the ideal setting for
Dial to make his mark and demonstrate his talent to the world.

Dial's upcoming headline performance has us giddy with anticipation, and we have no doubt that he
will astound the audience. He's not the only performer that night, either. Some of Brighton's most
brilliant up-and-coming DJs will provide backing for him. These up-and-coming musicians are the
scene's future, therefore we're delighted to be giving them the chance to perform with Dial.

Dial's headlining show at Music All Night is the ideal illustration of how music can bring people
together. To honour the impact of music, we're bringing together aspiring musicians, devoted
listeners, and music enthusiasts from all backgrounds. We are honoured to be a part of this night
because it is one not to be missed.

### The conclusion

To sum up, Dial's journey to his debut headlining performance in Brighton's Volks nightclub has been
one of love, devotion, and hard work. We hope to see you there as we commemorate this significant
occasion. Let's unite and acknowledge the influence of music.
